#### Installation

It is straightforward to download and install the `itewrpkg` package from GitHub using `install_github()` from the `devtools` package. Run `install.packages("devtools")` if you are not sure whether `devtools` is installed. The following one-liner installs `itewrpkg`:

```
devtools::install_github("mca91/itewrpkg")
```

Running the above command will also install all R packages which are required for reproducing the code examples presented throughout the book. Running `library(itewrpkg)` will load the package and all dependencies which makes it unnecessary to individually attach the packages introduced at the beginning of chapter. This may take a few seconds but may be convenient if you are playing around with code chunks from various chapters 

#### Functions

Upon attaching the package using `library(itewrpkg)` the following functions are available:

- `get_materials_itewr()`
_ `get_repo()`
- `get_repo_filenames()`
- `get_repo_files()`
- `squeeze_rmds`
